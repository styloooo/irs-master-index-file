# Building the IRS Master Index File

## Background

Currently we track nonprofits using files like the Business Master File or the Exempt Organizations List. There are many limitations to these files:

*	Data on the nonprofits is scattered across the BMF, SOI, 990 Returns, 990-EZ Returns, 990-N (postcard) Returns, the Revocation Database, and other files.
*	They only include the most recent information, so any changes to locations, activities, etc. are lost.
*	There is no historic overview and thus no way to track nonprofits.

The Master Index File is intended to provide a way to track and search all nonprofit returns in a single location to provide some basic reports on their operational status and 990 reporting. It will contain one row of data for each record we have of a nonprofit IRS filing, including amended filings and revocation records.
The intended use would be used to query active or dead organizations, and generate reports on 990 filing behaviors, and create a research sample framework that necessitates a document containing the universe of organizations.
